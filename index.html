                        <p>Hello, my name is Josshua Balita, and you can also call me Josh or JB :) I am currently enrolled as a Bow Valley College student majoring in Software Development. I've always been interested in learning about technologies, but it took me a while to discover my passion for programming, which led me to pursue a career in Software Development.</p>
                        <p>It all started when I moved to Calgary in 2021 from the beautiful mountains of Jasper which I lived there for 7 years finishing High School. I Discovered a free IT training and certification program. Over four months, I learned all the fundamentals of computers, from hardware and software to troubleshooting. After completing the program, I spent some time figuring out which field to focus on. I watched tons of technology-related videos and fell in love with coding and the excitement of learning something entirely new.</p>
                        <p>Now, I am always seeking new opportunities to advance my passion and knowledge.</p>
